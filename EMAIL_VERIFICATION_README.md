# Crypto Rewards Email Verification System

## Overview

We've implemented the email verification system for your website, just like Staking Rewards does. This document explains how to use and configure it.

## Current Status

- **Backend API**: https://crypto-rewards-tr-api-d191d680a3fa.herokuapp.com
- **Frontend**: https://crypto-rewards-comparison-turkey-e57a77jkw.vercel.app

## Email Verification vs Auto-Activation

We've provided two operation modes for your authentication system:

1. **Email Verification Mode** (like Staking Rewards)
   - New users need to verify their email address before they can log in
   - Requires proper email configuration
   - More secure and professional
   - Ensures only real email addresses are used

2. **Auto-Activation Mode**
   - Users are activated immediately after registration
   - No email verification required
   - Good for development/testing
   - Less secure, but easier to use

## Toggle Between Modes

We've created a simple script to let you toggle between these modes:

```bash
./toggle-verification.sh
```

This script will show you the current mode and let you switch between them.

## Setting Up Email Verification

For email verification to work properly, you need to configure a working email account:

1. **Gmail Setup**: Follow the instructions in `gmail-app-password-guide.md`
   - Create an App Password for Gmail
   - Update Heroku with the correct credentials

2. **Alternative Email Services**:
   - SendGrid: A popular email service with free tiers
   - MailGun: Another reliable email service
   - Mailtrap: For testing emails without sending them

## Testing the System

1. **Email Verification Test**:
   - Enable Email Verification mode
   - Register a new user
   - Check for verification email
   - Click verification link
   - Try to log in after verification

2. **Auto-Activation Test**:
   - Enable Auto-Activation mode
   - Register a new user
   - Try to log in immediately after registration

## Production Recommendations

For a professional production environment, we recommend:

1. **Using Email Verification** (like Staking Rewards)
2. **Setting up a dedicated email service** (SendGrid, MailGun, etc.)
3. **Configuring proper email templates** with your brand identity
4. **Setting up monitoring** for email deliverability

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check Heroku Logs**:
   ```bash
   heroku logs -a crypto-rewards-tr-api
   ```

2. **Verify Email Configuration**:
   ```bash
   heroku config -a crypto-rewards-tr-api | grep MAIL
   ```

3. **Reset Password for Testing**:
   The forgotten password flow also uses email, so it's a good test case

4. **Switch to Auto-Activation** temporarily if needed during development:
   ```bash
   ./toggle-verification.sh
   # Then choose option 1
   ```
