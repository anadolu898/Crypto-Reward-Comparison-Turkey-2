# Email Verification System Guide

## What's Implemented

We've implemented a proper email verification system that works similarly to Staking Rewards and other professional websites:

1. **Email-Based Verification**: When a user registers, they'll receive a verification email with a link to confirm their account
2. **Secure Token System**: Each verification link contains a unique, secure token that expires after a certain time
3. **User Account States**: Users start as inactive and only become active after verifying their email

## How It Works

1. **Registration Process**:
   - User fills in the registration form on the website
   - Backend validates the information and creates a new user account (marked as inactive)
   - A verification email is sent to the user's email address
   - User receives a "Check your email" message on the website

2. **Email Verification**:
   - User clicks the verification link in their email
   - The link takes them to the frontend verification page
   - Frontend sends the token to the backend
   - Backend validates the token and activates the account
   - User is now able to log in

3. **Login Process**:
   - If a user tries to log in before verifying their email, they receive a message that their account isn't active
   - They can request a new verification email if needed

## Email Configuration

We've configured the email system with the following settings:

- SMTP Server: smtp.gmail.com
- Port: 587
- TLS: Enabled
- Sender Email: info@rightbehind.app

## Testing the System

You can test the email verification by:

1. Registering a new user on the website
2. Checking the email inbox for the verification email
3. Clicking the verification link
4. Trying to log in after verification

## Troubleshooting

If verification emails aren't being received:

1. Check the Heroku logs for any email sending errors:
   ```
   heroku logs --tail -a crypto-rewards-tr-api
   ```

2. Verify the email credentials are correct:
   ```
   heroku config -a crypto-rewards-tr-api | grep MAIL
   ```

3. Make sure users are checking their spam folders

4. Try resending the verification email using the "Resend verification" option

## How This Compares to Staking Rewards

This implementation follows industry standard practices similar to Staking Rewards and other financial platforms:

1. Both require email verification before allowing account access
2. Both use secure, time-limited tokens for verification
3. Both provide a way to resend verification emails
4. Both implement proper security measures for account management

Your site now has a professional-grade authentication system that helps ensure only real users with verified email addresses can access the platform.
