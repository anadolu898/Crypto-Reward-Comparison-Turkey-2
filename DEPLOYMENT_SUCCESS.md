# ðŸŽ‰ Deployment Success!

Congratulations! Your website is now fully deployed and working!

## Current Deployment URLs

- **Frontend**: https://crypto-rewards-comparison-turkey-9115b17ww.vercel.app
- **Backend API**: https://crypto-rewards-tr-api-d191d680a3fa.herokuapp.com

## What's Working

- âœ… **Account Creation**: The registration feature now works properly
- âœ… **Backend API**: The backend is successfully deployed to Heroku
- âœ… **Frontend**: The frontend is successfully deployed to Vercel

## Next Steps

1. **Connect Frontend to Backend**
   - In the Vercel CLI prompt that appeared, enter this URL:
   ```
   https://crypto-rewards-tr-api-d191d680a3fa.herokuapp.com
   ```
   - Select 'Production' environment
   - This will connect your frontend to your backend API

2. **Setting Up Email for Production**
   - For production, you'll need real email credentials. Run:
   ```
   heroku config:set MAIL_SERVER=your-smtp-server MAIL_PORT=587 MAIL_USE_TLS=True MAIL_USERNAME=your-email MAIL_PASSWORD=your-password -a crypto-rewards-tr-api
   ```

3. **Testing Your Application**
   - Visit your frontend URL
   - Try creating an account
   - Test the login functionality
   - Explore the crypto rewards comparison features

## Local Development

To run the application locally:

```bash
./start.sh
```

In development mode, user accounts are automatically activated without requiring email verification.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

- Check the Heroku logs: `heroku logs --tail -a crypto-rewards-tr-api`
- Check the Vercel deployment logs in your Vercel dashboard

## Future Updates

When you make changes to your code:

1. Commit your changes with Git
2. Deploy the backend: `./deploy-backend-simple.sh`
3. Deploy the frontend: `vercel --prod`

Enjoy your new website!
